OpenRefine (Required)
OpenRefine is a graphical-interface tool for cleaning, transforming, and enriching imported metadata. OpenRefine is strongly recommended, as it will be discussed and utilized in-depth as section five of the workshop.

The latest stable release of OpenRefine is version 2.7; an earlier iteration (version 2.5) of the tool, known as Google Refine, still works, but the workshop will use version 2.7.
